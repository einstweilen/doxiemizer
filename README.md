### Background
The Doxie is great as long as the documents fit in the scanner. But how can you scan a document that is too large or too thick or has any glued or stapled objects on it? You simply can’t.

Doxiemizer allows you to combine documents from different sources in one Doxie document and save them as one OCR'ed PDF or stitched image. 

Take a photo of the document with your camera or mobile phone and use Doxiemizer to prepare the image files for import. If the document wont’t fit on one photo, just take two or more photos, choose Prepare for Stitching, stitch them together and choose Send to Prepare for OCR. 
## Installation

You can now import, OCR and Save the files like any scan from your Doxie scanner.

### IRIScan Anywhere 3 support
If you own an IRIScan Anywhere and a Doxie, Doxiemizer helps you to use the Doxie software with documents scanned on your IRIS scanner; you don’t have to rescan the files any more.

When you plug in your IRIS scanner or IRIS SD card or IRIS USB stick Doxiemizer automatically prepares a copy of the IRIS files and starts the Doxie software, just like the files were scanned by your Doxie. 

## F.A.Q.
#### Is the original Doxie software altered in any way?
No. Doxiemizer does not change one bit of the Doxie software.
#### Are the original image files altered in any way?
No. Doxiemizer always works with copies of your files.
####  I have noticed a temporary Doxiemizer volume - what is this?
The Doxiemizer volume is a RAM disc that holds the copy of your files. As the volume is only needed for the import it is unmounted directly after the Doxie software has finished importing the files.
####  What file formats are supported?
The Prepare for OCR feature supports jpg, gif, png, tiff, pict, bmp and PDF files.
The Prepare for Stitching feature supports jpg, gif, png, tiff, pict and bmp files. If the original file is not a JPG the file will be converted to JPG automatically.
#### What is the maximum file size?
The maximum file size for OCR is 5100 x 9000 pixels and for stitching 2400 x 3600 pixels. Larger files will be scaled down and padded automatically, the original aspect ration is preserved.
####  I cannot see the Prepare for OCR or Prepare for Stitching options in the context menu
or
#### I am missing some files from my selection on the import
Please check if the file type of the selected files is supported by Doxiemizer. See above „[Supported file formats](#what-is-the-maximum-file-size)“

Open Applications/Utilities/Console.app and look for Doxiemizer.log

####  O.K. I’ve found the log but what do P4O and P4S mean?
